Your task is to return only the category name of the file.

1.1. If the file name contains 'Execution_data', then it belongs to the 'Execução' category and ignore the rest of the rules;
1.2. If the file name contains 'Test_Execution_data', then it belongs to the 'Teste Execução' category and ignore the rest of the rules;
1.3. If the file name does not contain any of the text indicated above, then a categorization should be made by its content;
2. Content categorization:
2.1. If the file has a blank first line and then the columns 'ExecutionId, ExecutionStartDate, ExecutionEndDate, TaskWorkload, CaseStartDate, CaseEndDate, IsSuccessful, RunTimeSeconds, AverageRunTimeSeconds', then it is in the 'Execução' category.
2.2. If the file has in column A line 1 the label 'Test execution', in column A line 2 the label 'Total run time' and in list 4 the columns 'ExecutionId, IsSuccessful, RunTimeSeconds, ExecutionStartDate, ExecutionEndDate, TaskWorkload, CaseStartDate, CaseEndDate, AverageRunTimeSeconds', then it is in the 'Teste Execução' category.
2.3. If the file does not comply with the indicated cases, then it is considered as 'INVALIDO' category.
Your response should only include one JSON with the following format:
{
    "category": <category_name>
}
No code-blocks or MARKDOWN are allowed in the response.
